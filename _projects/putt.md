## Adaptive Robot Putter

Project Sponsor: [May We Help](https://maywehelp.org/)

The goal of this project was to develop a robot putter that can be used on a mini-golf course designed specifically for individuals who use mobile assistance and have a difficult time using a putter themselves. 

The player drives the robot around the putt-putt course with a joystick. When the approach the golf ball and get the robot aimed in the right direction, they press the putt button and the robot swings the putter!
