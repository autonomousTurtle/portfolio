## Adaptive Robot Putter

Project Sponsor: [May We Help](https://maywehelp.org/)

The goal of this project was to develop a robot putter that can be used on a mini-golf course designed specifically for individuals who use mobile assistance and have a difficult time using a putter themselves. 

The player drives the robot around the putt-putt course with a joystick. When the approach the golf ball and get the robot aimed in the right direction, they press the putt button and the robot swings the putter! 



### Development Gallery

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/landscape-02.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/landscape-03.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/landscape-04.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and weâ€™ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
