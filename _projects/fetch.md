## Self Fetching Robot

A robot inspired by Star Wars droid BB8 where the outside is just a rolling ball, and all the magic happens on the inside. This robot is designed to fit into a large tennis ball. It uses two drive wheels to move the ball around it's center, with the ability to move forward, backward, and turn. It has no perception to the environment other than an IMU and proximity readout to a bluetooth tag on the dog's collar
