## Biped Walking Robot with Camera
The purpose of this robot was to demonstrate self-balancing locomotion of an un-guided robot. Each leg uses 5 servos providing 3 degrees of freedom.


The 20KG servos use serial communication to talk to one another, allowing them to be connected to each other rather than each to a central drive board.
