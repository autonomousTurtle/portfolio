## RC Controller Adaptation

This project was for May We Help. The objective was to take an existing RC car controller for a toy dump truck and modify it so that it could be used with just one hand by adding a Wii Nunchuck. 


### Initial Controller (Before Modifications)

The initial controller design was fairly simple, all of the joysticks and buttons on the surface just pressed digital buttons on the controller PCB. 

### Modifications

To make the nunckuck work, an arduino teensy was used to interpret the nunchuck button inputs over I2C. It then sent digital outputs to MOSTFETS whose outputs interrupted the push button signal on the controller PCB, tricking the controller into thinking a button was actually pushed. This was then communicated to the RC car without ever modifying the car or RF components in any way.

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:
