subtitle: "Welcome to my proejct playgound. I believe projects fall into two categroies: they either teach you something or they accomplsih a finished product goal. Not everything on this porfolio is fully finished, but that's becuase it taught me what I needed to learn along to way to consider it complete!"

## Mission

I subscribe that our objective in life is to move the ball forward. To reduce pain and suffering, to increase equality, and make tomorrow better than today. My aim is to do that with technology and robotics. 


## Autonomous Turtle Origin
Turtle type robots (picture a small robot with two couple wheels and a domed top) were originally designed in the late 1940's as primitive educational tools, and have continuously  evolved since. Turtle robots continue to advance each year since the original design, becoming smarter, more perceptive, more capable. Turtle robots are training engineers and scientists to make the next generation of robots, one day achieving a fully autonomous turtle.
