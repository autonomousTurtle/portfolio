## Toolbox

Toolbox items are categorized by function: attaching, grabbing, taping, measuring, and drilling. 

I use a [Prusa MK3 3D Printer](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit-3/); this one is at least 6 years old and still runs like a dream! I highly recommend (I am not sponsored by Prusa)

*if you do purchase one, I recommend the kit and build it yourself. Absolute blast to build and a perfect example of how an instruction manual is supposed to be created.*
