subtitle: "Welcome to my proejct playgound. I believe projects fall into two categroies: they either teach you something or they accomplsih a finished product goal. Not everything on this porfolio is fully finished, but that's becuase it taught me what I needed to learn along to way to consider it complete!"

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
  <img src="/images/workshop/workshop_chest1.PNG">
	<img src="/images/workshop/workshop_attaching.PNG">
	<img src="/images/workshop/workshop_grabbing.PNG">
	<img src="/images/workshop/workshop_taping.PNG">
	<img src="/images/workshop/workshop_measuring.PNG">
	<img src="/images/workshop/workshop_drills.PNG">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/square-01.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/portrait-02.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/square-02.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/square-03.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/square-04.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/landscape-05.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.
